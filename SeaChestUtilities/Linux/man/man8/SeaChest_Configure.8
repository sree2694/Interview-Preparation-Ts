This option is the same as \fB\-\-scan\fR or \fB\-s\fR,
however it will also perform a low level rescan to pick up
other devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low
power states and may cause the OS to re\-enumerate them.
Use this option when a device is plugged in and not discovered in
a normal scan.
NOTE: A low\-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces or
all OSs. The low\-level rescan is not guaranteed to find additional
devices in the system when the device is unable to come to a ready state.
.HP
\fB\-\-SATInfo\fR

\fB\-\-sctReadTimer\fR [info | value] (SATA Only) (Seagate Only)
.IP
Use this option to set the read command timer value for
synchronous commands and NCQ commands with in\-order data
delivery enabled. Note: this timer starts at the time that
the drive processes the command, not the time it is received.
This timer value is volatile and is cleared at each power cycle.
Use the "info" argument to get the current status
of the read timer. A value of 0 means that all possible
error recovery will be performed before returning status.
Other values should include a unit to know the time to use.
If no unit is provided, it is assumed to be the value * 100 ms
.br
Ex1: \fB\-\-sctReadTimer\fR 15s for a 15 second timer.
.br
Ex2: \fB\-\-sctReadTimer\fR 15000ms for a 15 second timer expressed in milliseconds
.br
Ex2: \fB\-\-sctReadTimer\fR 150 for a 15 second timer with no units specified
.br
The maximum time that can be specified is 1 hour, 49 minutes, 13 seconds
Note: On some SAT HBAs/bridges, status will not be able to be
determined due to HBA/bridge limitations.
.HP
\fB\-\-sctWriteCache\fR [info | enable | disable | default] (SATA Only) (Seagate Only)
.IP
Use this option to enable or disable write cache
support on a drive using SMART command transport.

will always return success, but no write cache changes
will occur. This follows ATA spec.
Using the "default" argument returns the drive to
default settings and allowing the \fB\-\-writeCache\fR
option to work again.
Use the "info" argument to get the current status
of the write cache feature. Note: On some SAT
HBAs/bridges, status will not be able to be
determined due to HBA/bridge limitations.
.HP
\fB\-\-sctWriteCacheReordering\fR [info | enable | disable | default] (SATA Only) (Seagate Only)
.IP
Use this option to enable or disable write cache reordering
support on a drive using SMART command transport.
Write cache reordering allows the drive to reorder moving data
out of cache to media for better performance on synchronous
commands. Asynchronous commands are only affected when in\-order
data delivery is enabled.
When using this option, the setting is non\-volatile.
Use this with the \fB\-\-volatile\fR flag to make the
setting volatile.
Use the "info" argument to get the current status
of the write cache reordering feature. Note: On some SAT
HBAs/bridges, status will not be able to be
determined due to HBA/bridge limitations.
.HP
\fB\-\-sctWriteTimer\fR [info | value] (SATA Only) (Seagate Only)
.IP
Use this option to set the write command timer value for
synchronous commands and NCQ commands with in\-order data
delivery enabled. Note: this timer starts at the time that
the drive processes the command, not the time it is received.
This timer value is volatile and is cleared at each power cycle.
Use the "info" argument to get the current status
of the write timer. A value of 0 means that all possible
error recovery will be performed before returning status.
Other values should include a unit to know the time to use.
If no unit is provided, it is assumed to be the value * 100 ms
.br
Ex1: \fB\-\-sctWriteTimer\fR 15s for a 15 second timer.
.br
Ex2: \fB\-\-sctWriteTimer\fR 15000ms for a 15 second timer expressed in milliseconds
.br
