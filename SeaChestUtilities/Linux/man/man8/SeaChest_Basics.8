Utility Arguments
.br
=================
.HP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-scan\fR
.IP
Scan the system and list all storage devices with logical
/dev/sg? assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware
numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately
after booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.
.HP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-device\fR deviceHandle
.IP
Use this option with most commands to specify the device
handle on which to perform an operation. Example: /dev/sg?
.HP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-deviceInfo\fR
.IP
Show information and features for the storage device
.HP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-scanFlags\fR [option list]
.IP
Use this option to control the output from scan with the
options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
.br
ata \- show only ATA (SATA) devices
.br
usb \- show only USB devices
.br
scsi \- show only SCSI (SAS) devices
.br
interfaceATA \- show devices on an ATA interface
.br
interfaceUSB \- show devices on a USB interface
.br
interfaceSCSI \- show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
.br
sd \- show sd device handles
.br
sgtosd \- show the sd and sg device handle mapping
.HP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-Scan\fR
.IP
This option is the same as \fB\-\-scan\fR or \fB\-s\fR,
however it will also perform a low level rescan to pick up
other devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low
power states and may cause the OS to re\-enumerate them.
Use this option when a device is plugged in and not discovered in
a normal scan.
.br
NOTE: A low\-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces or
all OSs. The low\-level rescan is not guaranteed to find additional
devices in the system when the device is unable to come to a ready state.
.HP
\fB\-\-SATInfo\fR
.IP
Displays SATA device information on any interface
using both SCSI Inquiry / VPD / Log reported data
(translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log
reported data.
.HP
\fB\-\-testUnitReady\fR
.IP
Issues a SCSI Test Unit Ready command and displays the
status. If the drive is not ready, the sense key, asc,
ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable
translation from the SPC spec will be displayed if one
is available.
.HP
\fB\-\-checkPowerMode\fR
.IP
Get the current power mode of a drive.
On SCSI devices, this will only work if the drive has
transitioned from active state to another state.
.HP
\fB\-\-displayLBA\fR [LBA]
.IP
This option will read and display the contents of
the specified LBA to the screen. The display format
is hexadecimal with an ASCII translation on the side
(when available).
.TP
\fB\-\-activateFW\fR    (Seagate Only)
.IP
Use this option to issue the command to activate code that was
sent to the drive using a deferred download command. This will
immediately activate the new code on the drive.
You can use this along with a \fB\-\-downloadFW\fR & \fB\-\-downloadMode\fR to
automatically issue the activate command after the download has
completed.
.TP
\fB\-\-downloadFW\fR firmware_filename    (Seagate Only)
.IP
Download firmware to a Seagate storage product. Use only
Seagate authorized firmware data files which are designated for
the specific model drive. Improper use of this option may harm
a device and or its data. The Seagate utility seaflashlin is
available to handle batches of drives and for providing
additional controls for more complex installations.
This option will use segmented download by default. Use the
\fB\-\-downloadMode\fR option to specify a different download mode.
.TP
\fB\-\-downloadMode\fR [ full | segmented | deferred ]    (Seagate Only)
.IP
Use this option along with the \fB\-\-downloadFW\fR option
to set the firmware download mode.
.br
Supported Modes:
.br
full \- performs a download in one large
transfer to the device.
.br
segmented \- downloads the firmware in multiple
segments to the device. (Most compatible)
.br
deferred \- performs a segmented download to the
device, but does not activate the new
firmware until a powercycle or activate
command is sent.
.HP
\fB\-\-shortDST\fR
.IP
Execute a short diagnostic drive self test. This test can take
up to 2 minutes to complete. Use the \fB\-\-poll\fR argument to make
this operation poll for progress until complete. Use the
\fB\-\-progress\fR dst command to check on the completion percentage
(%) and test result.
.HP
\fB\-\-poll\fR
.IP
Use this option to cause another operation to poll for progress
until it has completed.  This argument does not return to the
command prompt and prints ongoing completion percentages (%)
the final test result.
Full drive procedures will take a
very long time.
Used with \fB\-\-sanitize\fR, or \fB\-\-writeSame\fR (SATA).
.HP
\fB\-\-progress\fR [dst]
.IP
Get the progress for a test that was started quietly without
the polling option (default). You must specify a test you wish to
get progress from. Ex: "\-\-progress dst" or "\-\-progress sanitize"
The progress counts up from 0% to 100%.
.HP
\fB\-\-abortDST\fR
.IP
Abort a diagnostic Drive Self Test that is in progress.
.HP
\fB\-\-phySpeed\fR [0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5] (Seagate Only)
.IP
Use this option to change the PHY speed to a
new maximum value. On SAS, this option will
set all phys to the specified speed unless the
\fB\-\-sasPhy\fR option is given to select a specific phy.
.br
0 \- allow full negotiation (default drive behavior)
.br
1 \- allow negotiation up to 1.5Gb/s
.br
2 \- allow negotiation up to 3.0Gb/s
.br

.br
5 \- allow negotiation up to 22.5Gb/s (SAS Only)
.HP
\fB\-\-readLookAhead\fR [info | enable | disable]
.IP
Use this option to enable or disable read look\-ahead
support on a drive. Use the "info" argument to get
the current status of the read look ahead feature.
.TP
\fB\-\-setMaxLBA\fR newMaxLBA    (Seagate Only)
.IP
Set the max accessible address of your drive to any value less
than the device's default native size. A power cycle is
required after this command before resetting or setting a new
max LBA.
.HP
\fB\-\-spinDown\fR
.IP
Removes power to the disk drive motor with the Standby Immediate
command. Use this before moving a hard disk drive. The drive
will spin back up if the operating system selects the drive.
This means that an active drive will not stay spun down.
.HP
\fB\-\-smartCheck\fR
.IP
Perform a SMART check on a device to see if any internal
thresholds have been tripped or if the drive is still operating
within specification.
.HP
\fB\-\-restoreMaxLBA\fR    (Seagate Only)

size. A power cycle is required after this command before
setting a new max LBA.
.HP
\fB\-\-writeCache\fR [info | enable | disable]
.IP
Use this option to enable or disable write cache
support on a drive. Use the "info" argument to get
the current status of the write cache feature.
.P
SATA Only:
.br
=========
.br
\fB\-\-smartAttributes\fR [raw | analyzed]      (SATA Only)
.IP
The drive will display its list of supported SMART attributes.
Some attributes names are commonly standard and most others are
vendor unique. In either case, the attribute thresholds are
always vendor unique. Most attributes are informational and not
used to determine a warranty return. Use the \fB\-\-smartCheck\fR
command to determine if one of the warranty attributes has been
tripped. Seagate Support does not help to analyze SMART
attributes.
.P
SAS Only:
.br
=========
.br
\fB\-\-readyLED\fR [info | on | off | default]    (SAS Only)
.IP
Use this option to get the current state or change the
behavior of the ready LED.
See the SPL spec for full details on how this changes LED
.br
info \- gets the current state of the ready LED.
.br
on \- sets the ready LED to usually off unless
processing a command.
.br
off \- sets the ready LED to usually on unless
processing a command
.br
default \- sets the ready LED to the drive's default value
.HP
\fB\-\-sasPhy\fR [phy number]    (SAS Only)
.IP
Use this option to specify a specific phy to use
with another option that uses a phy identifier value.
Some tool options will assume all SAS Phys when this
option is not present. Others will produce an error when
a specific phy is needed for an operation.
Use the \fB\-i\fR option to learn more about the supported phys.
.PP

that may respond in unintended ways since they may interpret
these commands differently than the bridge chip the command
was designed for.
