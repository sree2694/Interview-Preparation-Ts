Utility arguments
.br
=================
.HP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-scan\fR
.IP
Scan the system and list all storage devices with logical
/dev/sg? assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware
numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately
after booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.
.HP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-device\fR deviceHandle
.IP
Use this option with most commands to specify the device
handle on which to perform an operation. Example: /dev/sg?
.HP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-deviceInfo\fR
.IP
Show information and features for the storage device
.HP
\fB\-\-displayLBA\fR [LBA]
.IP
This option will read and display the contents of
the specified LBA to the screen. The display format
is hexadecimal with an ASCII translation on the side
(when available).
.HP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-scanFlags\fR [option list]
.IP
Use this option to control the output from scan with the
options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
.IP
ata \- show only ATA (SATA) devices
.br
usb \- show only USB devices
.br
scsi \- show only SCSI (SAS) devices
.br
interfaceATA \- show devices on an ATA interface
.br
interfaceUSB \- show devices on a USB interface
.br
interfaceSCSI \- show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
.br
sd \- show sd device handles
.br
sgtosd \- show the sd and sg device handle mapping
.HP
\fB\-\-poll\fR
.IP
Use this option to cause another operation to poll for progress
until it has completed.  This argument does not return to the
command prompt and prints ongoing completion percentages (%)
the final test result.
Full drive procedures will take a
very long time.
Used with \fB\-\-sanitize\fR, or \fB\-\-writeSame\fR (SATA).
.HP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-Scan\fR
.IP
This option is the same as \fB\-\-scan\fR or \fB\-s\fR,
however it will also perform a low level rescan to pick up
other devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low
power states and may cause the OS to re\-enumerate them.
Use this option when a device is plugged in and not discovered in
a normal scan.
.br
NOTE: A low\-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces or
all OSs. The low\-level rescan is not guaranteed to find additional
devices in the system when the device is unable to come to a ready state.
.HP
\fB\-\-SATInfo\fR
.IP
Displays SATA device information on any interface
using both SCSI Inquiry / VPD / Log reported data
(translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log
reported data.
.HP
\fB\-\-testUnitReady\fR
.IP
Issues a SCSI Test Unit Ready command and displays the
status. If the drive is not ready, the sense key, asc,
ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable
translation from the SPC spec will be displayed if one
is available.
.HP
\fB\-\-disableDataLocking\fR (Seagate Only)
.IP
Use this option to disable data locking on a TCG drive.
This option is only available when the drive has not had
SID changed (taken ownership). This prevents locking the
drive when it isn't being used with security software.
Once this operation is completed, you will not be able to
authenticate to SID as MSID. This can be undone with a revertSP
.br
Note: Not all Enterprise TCG drives support this feature or
they may need a firmware update to enable this capability
.HP
\fB\-\-fwdlPort\fR [lock | unlock] (Seagate Only)
.IP
This option will set the logical firmware download
port on a TCG drive to the requested state.
Use the \fB\-\-sid\fR option to provide SID for this operation.
If SID is not provided, MSID will be used.
.IP
lock \- lock the port and prevent its use
.br
unlock \- unlock the port to allow its use
.HP
\fB\-\-ieee1667Port\fR [lock | unlock] (Seagate Only)
.IP
This option will set the logical IEEE 1667
port on a TCG drive to the requested state.
Use the \fB\-\-sid\fR option to provide SID for this operation.
If SID is not provided, MSID will be used.
.IP
lock \- lock the port and prevent its use
.br
unlock \- unlock the port to allow its use
.HP
\fB\-\-showLockedRegions\fR
.IP
Use this option to show the locked ranges or bands
on TCG Opal or TCG Enterprise SED drives.
.HP
\fB\-\-tcgInfo\fR
.IP
This option shows information about a TCG device
.HP
\fB\-\-sid\fR
.IP
This option can be used to specify the value of SID.
This may be required in order to perform certain TCG
operations. If this is not provided, MSID will be used
.HP
\fB\-\-udsPort\fR [lock | unlock] (Seagate Only)
.IP
This option will set the logical UDS
port on a TCG drive to the requested state.
Use the \fB\-\-sid\fR option to provide SID for this operation.
If SID is not provided, MSID will be used.
.IP
lock \- lock the port and prevent its use
.br
unlock \- unlock the port to allow its use
.PP
Utility Options
.br
===============
.HP
\fB\-\-echoCommandLine\fR
.IP
Echo the command line entered into the utility on the screen.
.HP
\fB\-\-enableLegacyUSBPassthrough\fR
.IP
Only use this option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire)
products that do not otherwise work with the tool.
This option will enable a trial and error method that
attempts sending various ATA Identify commands through
vendor specific means. Because of this, certain products
that may respond in unintended ways since they may interpret
these commands differently than the bridge chip the command
was designed for.
.HP
\fB\-\-forceATA\fR
.IP
Using this option will force the current drive to
be treated as a ATA drive. Only ATA commands will
be used to talk to the drive.
.TP
\fB\-\-forceATADMA\fR    (SATA Only)
.IP
Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT
commands to ATA device using the protocol set to DMA
whenever possible (on DMA commands).
This option can be combined with \fB\-\-forceATA\fR
.TP
\fB\-\-forceATAPIO\fR    (SATA Only)
.IP
Using this option will force the tool to issue PIO
commands to ATA device when possible. This option can
be combined with \fB\-\-forceATA\fR
.TP
\fB\-\-forceATAUDMA\fR    (SATA Only)
.IP
Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT
commands to ATA device using the protocol set to UDMA
whenever possible (on DMA commands).
This option can be combined with \fB\-\-forceATA\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-forceSCSI\fR
.IP
Using this option will force the current drive to
be treated as a SCSI drive. Only SCSI commands will
be used to talk to the drive.
.HP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.IP
Show utility options and example usage (this output you see now)
Please report bugs/suggestions to seaboard@seagate.com.
Include the output of \fB\-\-version\fR information in the email.
.HP

.IP
Display the Seagate End User License Agreement (EULA).
.HP
\fB\-\-modelMatch\fR [model Number]
.IP
Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
model number. This option will provide a closest match although
an exact match is preferred. Ex: ST500 will match ST500LM0001
.HP
\fB\-\-onlyFW\fR [firmware revision]
.IP
Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
firmware revision. This option will only do an exact match.
.HP
\fB\-\-onlySeagate\fR
.IP
Use this option to match only Seagate drives for the options
provided
.HP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
.IP
Run SeaChest_Security in quiet mode. This is the same as
\fB\-v\fR 0 or \fB\-\-verbose\fR 0
.HP
\fB\-\-sat12byte\fR
.IP
This forces the lower layer code to issue SAT spec
ATA Pass\-through 12 byte commands when possible instead
of 16 byte commands. By default, 16 byte commands are
always used for ATA Pass\-through.
.HP
\fB\-v\fR [0\-4], \fB\-\-verbose\fR [0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4]
.IP
Show verbose information. Verbosity levels are:
.br

.HP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
.IP
Show SeaChest_Security version and copyright information & exit
.PP
Data Destructive Commands (Seagate only)
.br
========================================
.HP
\fB\-\-revert\fR
.IP
This operation performs an Opal SSC spec Revert on an SED drive.
This operation is only available on Seagate TCG Opal drives.
In order to complete this operation, the lockingSP must not be
activated, as this option will activate it in order to perform
the revert. The value of SID, must also be the value of MSID
as this operation must authenticate as SID using the value of
MSID. Upon completion, the drive will be "like new" with all
user data being cryptographically erased and all other settings
set to factory defaults. If this operation fails, use \fB\-\-revertSP\fR
instead.
.HP
\fB\-\-revertSP\fR DrivePSID
.IP
This operation performs an Opal SSC spec revertSP on a Seagate.
SED drive. This operation is available on all Seagate SED
drives. Upon completion, the drive will be "like new" with
all user data being cryptographically erased and all other
settings set to factory defaults.
