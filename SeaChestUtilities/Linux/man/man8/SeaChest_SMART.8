========
.IP
SeaChest_SMART \fB\-\-scan\fR
.br
SeaChest_SMART \fB\-d\fR /dev/sg? \fB\-i\fR
.PP
Utility Arguments
.br
=================
.HP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-scan\fR
.IP
Scan the system and list all storage devices with logical
/dev/sg? assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware
numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately
after booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.
.HP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-device\fR deviceHandle
.IP
Use this option with most commands to specify the device
handle on which to perform an operation. Example: /dev/sg?
.HP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-deviceInfo\fR
.IP
Show information and features for the storage device
.HP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-scanFlags\fR [option list]
.IP
Use this option to control the output from scan with the
options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
.IP
ata \- show only ATA (SATA) devices
.br
usb \- show only USB devices
.br
scsi \- show only SCSI (SAS) devices
.br
interfaceATA \- show devices on an ATA interface
.br
interfaceUSB \- show devices on a USB interface
.br
interfaceSCSI \- show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
.br
sd \- show sd device handles
.br
sgtosd \- show the sd and sg device handle mapping
.HP
\fB\-\-poll\fR
.IP
Use this option to cause another operation to poll for progress
until it has completed.  This argument does not return to the
command prompt and prints ongoing completion percentages (%)
the final test result.
Full drive procedures will take a
very long time.
Used with \fB\-\-sanitize\fR, or \fB\-\-writeSame\fR (SATA).
.HP
\fB\-\-progress\fR [dst, idd]
.IP
Get the progress for a test that was started quietly without
the polling option (default). You must specify a test you wish to
get progress from. Ex: "\-\-progress dst" or "\-\-progress sanitize"
The progress counts up from 0% to 100%.
.HP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-Scan\fR
.IP
This option is the same as \fB\-\-scan\fR or \fB\-s\fR,
however it will also perform a low level rescan to pick up
other devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low
power states and may cause the OS to re\-enumerate them.
Use this option when a device is plugged in and not discovered in
a normal scan.
.br
NOTE: A low\-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces or
all OSs. The low\-level rescan is not guaranteed to find additional
devices in the system when the device is unable to come to a ready state.
.HP
\fB\-\-SATInfo\fR
.IP
Displays SATA device information on any interface
using both SCSI Inquiry / VPD / Log reported data
(translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log
reported data.
.HP
\fB\-\-testUnitReady\fR
.IP
Issues a SCSI Test Unit Ready command and displays the
status. If the drive is not ready, the sense key, asc,
ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable
translation from the SPC spec will be displayed if one
is available.
.HP
\fB\-\-abortDST\fR
.IP
Abort a diagnostic Drive Self Test that is in progress.
.HP
\fB\-\-abortIDD\fR (Seagate Only)
.IP
Abort a Seagate In Drive Diagnostic (IDD) that is in progress.
.HP
\fB\-\-captive\fR or \fB\-\-foreground\fR
.IP
Use this option to run a DST operation in captive/foreground
mode. This mode may allow a device to test more of itself and
may be slightly faster than offline/background mode since it does
not need to service additional command during the test.
When using this mode, the utility must wait the entire time for
the DST to complete and progress cannot be indicated during this time.
.HP
\fB\-\-conveyanceDST\fR
.IP
Execute a conveyance diagnostic drive self test. A conveyance
test can be used to check if a drive has incurred handling damage.
This test can take up to 2 minutes to complete. Use the \fB\-\-poll\fR
argument to make this operation poll for progress until complete.
Use the \fB\-\-progress\fR dst command to check on the completion
percentage (%) and test result.
.HP
\fB\-\-errorLimit\fR [limit in number of LBAs]
.IP
Use this option to specify a different error
limit for a user generic or long generic read
test or DST and Clean. This must be a number of
logical LBAs to have errors. If a drive has multiple
logical sectors per physical sector, this number will
be adjusted for you to reflect the drive
architecture.
.TP
\fB\-\-idd\fR [short | long]    (Seagate Only)
.IP
Start an In Drive Diagnostic (IDD) test on a Seagate
drive. Not all tests are supported by all products. If a
selected test is not supported, the utility will return
a error code meaning "not supported".
.br
Short:  Reset and Recalibration test. Be careful running this
test on the boot device.
.br
Long:  Reset and Recalibration test and test G list and
P list
.IP
Note: the \fB\-\-captive\fR option can be added to run the long test in
foreground/captive mode. This allows for G\-list healing
and some additional checks to be performed. This may not
work on some products.
.HP
\fB\-\-longDST\fR
.IP
Execute a long diagnostic drive self test. This test takes
hours to complete.  A 2TB drive may take six (6) hours to
complete. Use with the \fB\-\-poll\fR argument to let SeaChest check
for progress and print it to the screen until complete.
Use the \fB\-\-progress\fR dst command to check on the completion
percentage(%) and test result.
This test stops on the first error. Use \fB\-\-abortDST\fR
to manually stop the test. SAS drives give status in 1%
increments. SATA drivs give status in 10% increments which
means more than an hour may elapse between updates on a SATA
drive > 2TB.
.IP
If the \fB\-\-longDST\fR poll option is running and you want to abort
the test then you will need to open a second terminal window
and run the \fB\-\-abortDST\fR command. Otherwise, it is safe to
restart the system while long DST is running which also ends the
test.
.HP
\fB\-\-shortDST\fR
.IP
Execute a short diagnostic drive self test. This test can take
up to 2 minutes to complete. Use the \fB\-\-poll\fR argument to make
this operation poll for progress until complete. Use the
\fB\-\-progress\fR dst command to check on the completion percentage
(%) and test result.
.HP
\fB\-\-showDSTLog\fR
.IP
This option will show the entries in the DST log.
Up to 21 entries may be shown (pending drive support)
and will be shown with the most recent entry first.
.HP
\fB\-\-smartCheck\fR
.IP
Perform a SMART check on a device to see if any internal
thresholds have been tripped or if the drive is still operating
within specification.
.TP
\fB\-\-smartFeature\fR [ enable | disable ]    (SATA Only) (Seagate Only)
.IP
Use this option to enable or disable the SMART
feature on a SATA drive.

SATA Only:
.br
=========
.br
\fB\-\-smartAttributes\fR [raw | analyzed]      (SATA Only)
.IP
The drive will display its list of supported SMART attributes.
Some attributes names are commonly standard and most others are
vendor unique. In either case, the attribute thresholds are
always vendor unique. Most attributes are informational and not
used to determine a warranty return. Use the \fB\-\-smartCheck\fR
command to determine if one of the warranty attributes has been
tripped. Seagate Support does not help to analyze SMART
attributes.
.TP
\fB\-\-smartAttributeAutosave\fR [ enable | disable ]    (SATA Only) (Seagate Only)
.IP
Use this option to enable or disable SMART
attribute auto\-save on an ATA drive.
Note: This command is declared obsolete in ACS4.
.TP

auto\-off\-line feature on an ATA drive.
.HP
\fB\-\-showSMARTErrorLog\fR [ summary | comprehensive ] (SATA Only)
.IP
This option will display the ATA SMART Error log on the screen.
Use "summary" to view the summary SMART error log (last 5 entries)
Use "comprehensive" to view all the entires the drive has available.
Specifying "comprehensive" will automatically pull the ext error log
on drives that support 48bit LBAs.
.br
Note: The summary error log will truncate 48bit commands, so some information
will be missing to desribe the operation of certain commands.
.TP
\fB\-\-smartErrorLogFormat\fR [ raw | detailed ]    (SATA Only)
.IP
Use this option to change the format of the output from the \fB\-\-showSMARTErrorLog\fR
option. The default mode is "detailed"

.br
6 \- Report on request
.TP
\fB\-\-showSCSIDefects\fR [ p | g | pg ]    (SAS Only)
.IP
This option will display the SCSI defects on the screen.
The arguments to this will tell whether to get the grown,
primary, or primary and grown defects from the drive.
Use the \fB\-\-defectFormat\fR option to specify the mode to display the defects.
