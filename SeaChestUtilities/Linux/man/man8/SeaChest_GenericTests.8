Utility Arguments
.br
=================
.HP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-scan\fR
.IP
Scan the system and list all storage devices with logical
/dev/sg? assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware
numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately
after booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.
.HP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-device\fR deviceHandle
.IP
Use this option with most commands to specify the device
handle on which to perform an operation. Example: /dev/sg?
.HP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-deviceInfo\fR
.IP
Show information and features for the storage device
.HP
\fB\-\-displayLBA\fR [LBA]
.IP
This option will read and display the contents of
the specified LBA to the screen. The display format
is hexadecimal with an ASCII translation on the side
(when available).
.HP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-scanFlags\fR [option list]
.IP
Use this option to control the output from scan with the
options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
.IP
ata \- show only ATA (SATA) devices
.br
usb \- show only USB devices
.br
scsi \- show only SCSI (SAS) devices
.br
interfaceATA \- show devices on an ATA interface
.br
interfaceUSB \- show devices on a USB interface
.br
interfaceSCSI \- show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
.br
sd \- show sd device handles
.br
sgtosd \- show the sd and sg device handle mapping
.HP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-Scan\fR
.IP
This option is the same as \fB\-\-scan\fR or \fB\-s\fR,
however it will also perform a low level rescan to pick up
other devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low
power states and may cause the OS to re\-enumerate them.
Use this option when a device is plugged in and not discovered in
a normal scan.
.br
NOTE: A low\-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces or
all OSs. The low\-level rescan is not guaranteed to find additional
devices in the system when the device is unable to come to a ready state.
.HP
\fB\-\-SATInfo\fR
.IP
Displays SATA device information on any interface
using both SCSI Inquiry / VPD / Log reported data
(translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log
reported data.
.HP
\fB\-\-testUnitReady\fR
.IP
Issues a SCSI Test Unit Ready command and displays the
status. If the drive is not ready, the sense key, asc,
ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable
translation from the SPC spec will be displayed if one
is available.
.HP
\fB\-\-bufferTest\fR
.IP
This option will perform a test using the device's echo buffer.
The write buffer and read buffer commands are used to send &
receive different data patterns. The patterns are compared
and interface CRC errors are also checked (when available).
Test patterns performed are all 0's, all F's, all 5's, all A's,
walking 1's, walking 0's, and random data patterns.
At completion, a count of the number of errors will be displayed.
.HP
\fB\-\-butterflyTest\fR
.IP
Use this option to start a butterfly test.
A butterfly test is a test that moves
back and forth between the OD and ID of the drive
over and over again until the time has expired
This is a timed operation. Use the time options
to control how long to run this test for. The
default time for this test is 1 minute.
.HP
\fB\-\-diameterTest\fR [O | M | I]
.IP
Use this option to perform a generic read/write/verify
test at the specified diameter of the drive.
Use the time options to specify a time based test or
the \fB\-\-diameterTestRange\fR option for a range based test.
.IP
O \- outer diameter
.br
M \- middle diameter
.br
I \- inner diameter
.IP
The different diameters can be combined or run individually.
.br
Ex1: \fB\-\-diameterTest\fR OMI
.br
Ex2: \fB\-\-diameterTest\fR O
.br
Ex3: \fB\-\-diameterTest\fR MI
.HP
\fB\-\-diameterTestRange\fR [range]
.IP
Use this option with the \fB\-\-diameterTest\fR option to
perform a range based test. If a range is
specified without any units, it is assumed
to be an LBA count.
.br
Valid units are KB, KiB, MB, MiB, GB, GiB, TB
and TiB.
.br
Ex1: "\-\-diameterTestRange 1234567" for an LBA count
.br
Ex2: "\-\-diameterTestRange 2GB" for a 2GB range.
.HP
\fB\-\-errorLimit\fR [limit in number of LBAs]
.IP
Use this option to specify a different error
limit for a user generic or long generic read
test or DST and Clean. This must be a number of
logical LBAs to have errors. If a drive has multiple
logical sectors per physical sector, this number will
be adjusted for you to reflect the drive
architecture.
.HP
\fB\-\-genericMode\fR [ read | write (Seagate Only) | verify ]
.IP
This options allows selection of the type of commands
to use while performing a generic test. The modes supported
are listed below:
.IP
read \- performs a generic test using read commands
.br
write \- performs a generic test using write commands (Seagate Only)
.br
verify \- performs a generic test using verify commands
.HP
\fB\-\-hours\fR [hours]
.IP
Use this option to specify a time in hours
for a timed operation to run.
.HP
\fB\-\-longGeneric\fR
.IP
This option will run a long generic read test on a
specified device. A long generic read test reads every
LBA on the device and gives a report of error LBAs at
the end of the test, or when the error limit has been
reached. Using the \fB\-\-stopOnError\fR option will make this
test stop on the first read error that occurs.
The default error limit is 50 x number of logical
sectors per physical sector. Example error limits
are as follows:
.IP
512L/512P: error limit = 50
.br
4096L/4096P: error limit = 50
.br
512L/4096P: error limit = 400 (50 * 8)
.HP
\fB\-\-minutes\fR [minutes]
.IP
Use this option to specify a time in minutes
for a timed operation to run.
.HP
\fB\-\-randomTest\fR
.IP
Use this option to start a random test.
This is a timed operation. Use the time options
to control how long to run this test for. The
default time for this test is 1 minute.
.HP
\fB\-\-seconds\fR [seconds]
.IP
Use this option to specify a time in seconds
for a timed operation to run.
.HP
\fB\-\-shortGeneric\fR
.IP
This option will run a short generic read test on a
specified device. A short generic read test has 3
components. A read at the Outer Diameter (OD) of the
drive for 1% of the LBAs, then a read at the Inner
Diameter of the drive for 1% of the LBAs, and lastly
a random read of 5000 LBAs. This test will stop on
the first read error that occurs.
.HP
\fB\-\-stopOnError\fR
.IP
Use this option to make a generic read test
stop on the first error found.
.HP
\fB\-\-twoMinuteGeneric\fR
.IP
This option will run a 2 minute generic read test on
a specified device. There are 3 components to this test.
A read at the Outer Diameter (OD) of the drive for 45
seconds, then a read at the Inner Diameter of the
drive for 45 seconds, and lastly a random read test
for 30 seconds. This test will stop on the first
read error that occurs.
.HP
\fB\-\-userGenericStart\fR [LBA]
.IP
Use this option to specify the starting LBA number for a
generic read test. The \fB\-\-userGenericRange\fR option must be used
with this one in order to start the test.  Use the stop on
error, repair flags, and/or error limit flags to further
customize this test.
.HP
\fB\-\-userGenericRange\fR [range]
.IP
Use this option to specify the range for a
generic read test. See the \fB\-\-userGenericStart\fR
help for additional information about using
the User Generic Read tests.
