a alone can do a piece of work in 6 days and b alone in 8 days. a and b undertook 3200. with the help of c, they completed the work in 3 days

C's 1 day's work =	1	-		1	+	1		=	1	-	7	=	1	.
3	6	8	3	24	24
A's wages : B's wages : C's wages =	1	:	1	:	1	= 4 : 3 : 1.
6	8	24
C's share (for 3 days) = Rs.		3 x	1	x 3200		= Rs. 400.




Two dice are tossed. The probability that the total score is a prime number is:
Clearly, n(S) = (6 x 6) = 36.
Let E = Event that the sum is a prime number.
Then E= { (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4,3),(5, 2), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5) }
n(E) = 15.
P(E) = n(E)/n(S) = 15/36 = 5/12.
